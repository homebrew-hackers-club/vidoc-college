# Chapter 1 — GitHub 🐙

<AiVideo 
script="Welcome to Chapter 1! In this chapter, we're going to dive into GitHub, which is essentially your code's home on the internet. Think of GitHub like Google Drive, but specifically designed for developers and code. It's a cloud-based platform where you store your projects, but it's way cooler than regular cloud storage because it does something magical—it remembers every single change you make to your code.

Imagine you're writing a book and every time you edit a sentence, someone takes a snapshot of that exact moment. Later, if you realize you preferred a version from three days ago, you can travel back in time and restore it. That's what GitHub does for code—it's like a time machine for your projects.

GitHub is built on top of something called Git, which is a version control system. Version control might sound intimidating, but it's just a fancy way of saying 'keeping track of changes.' Every time you save a change, Git takes a snapshot. You can see who changed what, when they changed it, and why. This makes collaboration possible and mistakes reversible.

In this chapter, we'll walk through setting up your GitHub account step by step, verifying your email, and creating your very first repository—which is just a fancy word for a folder where your project lives. We'll add a README file, which is like the front page of your project that explains what it is and how to use it.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a verified GitHub account, your first repository with a README, and the foundation for everything else we'll build throughout this course. This is your first step into the coding world, and trust me, GitHub is going to become your best friend!"

Welcome to your first step into the coding world! Before we start building anything, we need a place to store our code. Think of GitHub as your code's home on the internet — a place where everything lives, changes get tracked, and you can share your projects with the world.

## What Is GitHub, Really? 🤔

Let's break this down in simple terms. GitHub is like Google Drive, but specifically designed for code. Just like you might store photos or documents in the cloud, developers store their code projects on GitHub. But it's way cooler than regular cloud storage because it does something magical: it remembers every single change you make.

Imagine you're writing a book, and every time you edit a sentence, someone takes a snapshot of that exact moment. Later, if you realize you preferred a version from three days ago, you can travel back in time and restore it. That's what GitHub does for code — it's like a time machine for your projects.

GitHub is built on top of something called "Git," which is a version control system. Version control might sound intimidating, but it's just a fancy way of saying "keeping track of changes." Every time you save a change (called a "commit"), Git takes a snapshot. You can see who changed what, when they changed it, and why. This makes collaboration possible and mistakes reversible.

For now, don't worry about understanding all the technical details. What matters is that GitHub is where your code lives online, and it's going to become your best friend throughout this course.

## Setting Up Your GitHub Account 📝

Alright, let's get you set up! The process is straightforward, and you'll be done in just a few minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up

Head over to [github.com](https://github.com) and click the "Sign up" button in the top right corner. You'll need to choose a username — this is how other developers will identify you in the GitHub community. Pick something you like, but keep it professional since this might appear on your portfolio later. Your username can include letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Next, enter your email address. GitHub will send you a verification email, so make sure you use an address you can access. After entering your email, create a password. GitHub requires a strong password, so make it at least 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

### Step 2: Verify Your Email ✅

Check your inbox (and spam folder, just in case) for a verification email from GitHub. Click the verification link inside. This step is important because it helps keep your account secure and allows you to use all of GitHub's features.

### Step 3: Welcome Screen

Once you verify your email, GitHub will ask you a few questions about your experience level. Since you're just starting out, don't be shy about selecting "Beginner" or "I'm new to coding." This helps GitHub tailor your experience, but you can always change these settings later.

## Creating Your First Repository 🗂️

Now for the exciting part — creating your first repository! A repository (or "repo" for short) is like a folder where your project lives. Each repository can contain code files, images, documentation, and anything else your project needs.

### What Makes a Good Repository Name?

For your first project, let's call it something like `my-first-landing-page` or `hello-vybe-world`. Keep it lowercase and use hyphens instead of spaces. This might seem like a small detail, but it's a convention that makes URLs cleaner and easier to share.

### Creating the Repository

Click the "+" icon in the top right corner of GitHub and select "New repository." You'll see a form with several options:

**Repository name:** Enter something like `hello-vybe-world` or `my-personal-site`

**Description:** This is optional, but it's helpful to add a short sentence like "My first landing page built with V0 and Vercel"

**Visibility:** Choose **Public**. Public repositories are free, and anyone can see them. Private repos require a paid plan. For learning purposes, public repos are perfect — you can show off your work, and it's free!

**Initialize this repository with:** Check the box next to **"Add a README file"**. A README is like the front page of your project. It explains what the project is, how to use it, and provides any important information.

**Add .gitignore:** Leave this as "None" for now — we don't need it yet.

**Choose a license:** This is optional for now. A license tells others what they can and can't do with your code. If you want to share your work freely, the MIT license is a popular choice for beginners. But you can skip this for now and add it later if you want.

Click the big green "Create repository" button, and boom! 🎉 You've just created your first repository.

## Understanding Your New Repository 📚

Once your repository is created, you'll land on its main page. Let's quickly go through what you're looking at:

**The top section** shows your repository name, description, and a URL that looks like `github.com/yourusername/repo-name`. This URL is important — you'll need it soon when we connect it to other services.

**The README.md file** is visible right below. This is a Markdown file (that's what `.md` means) that GitHub automatically displays on your repo's main page. You can edit it to add information about your project, instructions, or anything else you want visitors to know.

**The green "Code" button** contains the repository URL. You'll use this to connect your local code to GitHub later in the course.

## Why This Matters 🎯

You might be thinking, "Okay, I've created an account and a repository, but what's the big deal?" Here's why this matters:

**Backup and Safety:** Your code is now stored in the cloud. Even if your computer crashes, your code is safe.

**Sharing:** Once your project is live (which we'll do soon!), you can share the GitHub link with anyone. Potential employers, friends, or collaborators can see your work.

**Learning:** GitHub is used by millions of developers worldwide. Being comfortable with GitHub early on puts you ahead of the curve.

**Collaboration:** Eventually, you might want to work with others or contribute to open-source projects. GitHub makes all of that possible.

## What's Next? 🚀

Great job! You've completed the first step in your coding journey. You now have:
- ✅ A GitHub account
- ✅ Your first repository with a README
- ✅ The foundation for everything else we'll build

In the next chapter, we'll set up Vercel — a platform that will take your code and turn it into a live website that anyone can visit. But first, make sure to copy your repository URL from the browser's address bar. It should look something like `https://github.com/yourusername/hello-vybe-world`. You'll need it soon!

## Outcome Checklist ✨

Before moving on, make sure you have:
- A verified GitHub account
- A public repository with a README
- Your repository URL copied somewhere safe
