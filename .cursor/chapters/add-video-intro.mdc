When the user is working on a course `index.mdx`, generate an `<AiVideo />` component based on that index content.

This is a short **introduction video for the entire course**, not for an individual chapter.

The component must follow this format exactly:

<AiVideo
  script="<GENERATED_SCRIPT>"
/>

Where <GENERATED_SCRIPT> is a spoken-style teaching script designed for an AI avatar.

Requirements for <GENERATED_SCRIPT>:
- It must be written as natural spoken narration, not as an article or essay.
- Sentences should be short, clear, and conversational.
- Focus on explaining the course's big picture: who it's for, what they'll learn, and why it matters.
- Do NOT repeat or copy the `index.mdx` text. Transform it into a clean, engaging narrative.
- Use a friendly, confident instructor tone (educational, but not overly formal).
- The entire script should feel like a 1–3 minute educational course intro video.
- Script must contain plain text only — no markdown, no formatting, no quotes around paragraphs.
- Keep it around 100-200 words
- Always put the video in the beginng of the file after frontmatter 


Purpose of the video:
- Help the learner quickly understand what the course is about and who it's for.
- Deliver a clear, engaging overview of the core topics and skills covered.
- Set expectations for the learning journey (structure, modules/chapters, and outcomes).
- Motivate the learner to start the course with confidence and curiosity.
- Provide a concise, instructor-style presentation suitable for an AI avatar.
